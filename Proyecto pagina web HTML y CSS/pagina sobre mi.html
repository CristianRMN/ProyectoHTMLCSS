        <p>Hello! I am an enthusiastic person passionate about software development. I firmly believe that the world of technology is a space where creativity
          and innovation come together to create impactful solutions. With a solid background in application development and a passion for
           constantly learning, I have worked on several projects that have allowed me to develop my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript
           and frameworks like React. My main focus has been on creating intuitive and functional user experiences that really make a difference.
          In addition to my technical skills, I consider myself a collaborative and team-oriented person. I enjoy working in environments where the exchange
           of ideas is welcome and where each member contributes their unique knowledge to achieve common objectives. Solving problems and overcoming
           Challenges are part of my daily life, and I love facing new situations that allow me to grow both professionally and personally.
